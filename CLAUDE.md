# CLAUDE.md

Primary context for any Claude Code instance working on this repo. Read this fully before making changes.

## Project Purpose

Internal AI enablement system for a coaching/consulting agency. Replaces and augments human work across customer success, sales, and operations. The consumer business runs on this system first; later, the same system will be deployed to other agencies as a productized consulting offering.

**Immediate focus:** ship Slack Bot V1 and CSM Co-Pilot V1 by end of April.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These four principles protect the system from lock-in and rebuilds. Apply them to every decision.

1. **Our database is the source of truth.** Every piece of data we touch is mirrored into Supabase. External tools are secondary.
2. **Agents query our database, not external tools.** An agent never calls Fathom, Slack, or the CRM directly for data. Ingestion pipelines populate Supabase; agents read from Supabase.
3. **External tools are replaceable adapters.** Each integration lives in its own module. Swapping any one is a contained rewrite, not a system-wide migration.
4. **Interfaces are thin clients on a shared brain.** Agent logic lives in one place, exposed via API. Slack, future web portals, email — all just front doors. No business logic in interface code.

## Stack

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + pgvector) | Source of truth. All data mirrored here. |
| Backend / Agents | Python 3.11+ | Primary language. FastAPI for services. |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 + TypeScript | Dashboards and approval UI. |
| Orchestration | n8n (self-hosted) | Workflows, scheduling, HITL routing. Zain builds workflows; they get imported into our n8n. |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude API | Sonnet as default, Opus for complex reasoning, Haiku for simple/cheap tasks. |
| Hosting | Vercel | Frontend + serverless Python functions. |
| Voice | ElevenLabs | Course audio, future voice agents. |
| Dev environment | WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows | All dev happens inside WSL. VS Code with Remote-WSL extension. |
| Secrets | Bitwarden master list + env vars | `.env.local` locally, Vercel env vars in production. |

## Language Policy

- **Python first** for agents, ingestion pipelines, evals, scripts, data work
- **TypeScript** for Next.js frontend and browser code
- **Other languages only when no reasonable Python or TS option exists.** Ask before introducing a new language.

## Conventions

### Code

- **Python:** PEP 8. Type hints everywhere. Format with `black`, lint with `ruff`.
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode on. Format with Prettier, lint with ESLint.
- **No one-letter variables** except tight loops (`i`, `j`).
- **Functions do one thing.** Split if exceeding ~50 lines.
- **Pure functions where possible.** Side effects (DB writes, API calls) isolated in thin layers.

### Naming

- Python files/modules: `snake_case.py`
- Python classes: `PascalCase`
- Python functions/variables: `snake_case`
- TypeScript files: `kebab-case.ts` or `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- Database tables: `snake_case`, plural (`clients`, `calls`, `messages`)
- Database columns: `snake_case`
- Environment variables: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

### Documentation (Non-Negotiable)

Every substantive change updates documentation in the same commit.

- **New database table** → new file in `docs/schema/` with: purpose, columns, relationships, what populates it, what reads from it, example queries
- **New agent** → new file in `docs/agents/` with: purpose, inputs, outputs, data dependencies, escalation rules, eval criteria
- **New ingestion pipeline** → runbook in `docs/runbooks/` covering: what it does, schedule, failure modes, debugging
- **Significant architectural decision** → new ADR in `docs/decisions/` using the standard template

Documentation is not optional and not written "later." It ships alongside the code.

### Commits

- Commit frequently — every meaningful unit of work, even if imperfect
- Commit messages: short, declarative, present tense
  - Good: `add clients table migration`
  - Good: `ingest fathom transcripts into KB`
  - Good: `fix slack bot threading on DM replies`
  - Bad: `updates`, `fixed stuff`, `wip`
- Never commit secrets. Run `git diff` before every commit to scan for keys.

### Error Handling

- External API calls always wrapped with retry + timeout + structured logging
- Database writes transactional when multiple tables are affected
- Agent failures escalate to HITL rather than silently failing
- Never swallow exceptions without logging them

## Critical Rules

### Never Do

- **Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file with credentials.**
- **Never install a new major dependency without asking first.** Adding `langchain` or similar heavy frameworks is a big commitment.
- **Never write code without updating the corresponding documentation.** Code and docs ship together.
- **Never couple agent logic to a specific external tool.** Agents query the KB. If you find yourself writing `fathom_client.get_call(...)` inside an agent, stop — move the fetch into the ingestion layer, persist to Supabase, then query from the agent.
- **Never bypass the HITL pattern.** If an agent is uncertain, escalate. Do not guess confidently.
- **Never use `print()` for anything that should persist.** Use structured logging via `shared/logging.py`.

### Always Do

- **Always ingest data through the ingestion layer, not from agents.** If an agent needs data not yet in the KB, extend an ingestion pipeline — do not reach out from the agent.
- **Always write an eval before considering an agent "done."** Minimum 20 golden examples per agent, 90% pass rate to ship.
- **Always ask before introducing new external services, libraries, or languages.**
- **Always read the relevant `docs/` files before editing a component.**

## Current Focus

**Now:** Phase 0 foundation — Supabase schema, Fathom and Slack ingestion pipelines, eval harness scaffolding, shared utilities.

**End of April target:** Slack Bot V1 and CSM Co-Pilot V1 shipped and running on real data.

## Working With Claude Code — Prompting Tips

Give Claude Code context like you'd give a new senior engineer, not like a magic wish granter.

Bad:

> Build the Slack bot.

Good:

> We're building Slack Bot V1 per `docs/agents/slack_bot.md`. Ingest from the `documents` and `messages` tables via `shared/kb_query.py`. Follow the HITL pattern in `shared/hitl.py`. Start with the incoming Slack event handler. Write code, update `docs/agents/slack_bot.md` as you go, add at least 10 golden examples to `evals/slack_bot/`.

After Claude Code generates meaningful code, ask: **"Explain what this does and what could go wrong."** Catches most issues before they compound.

## Update Policy for This File

Update CLAUDE.md whenever:
- A core principle is clarified or extended
- A stack choice changes
- A new major convention is adopted
- The current focus shifts to a new phase

Treat it as living documentation. A stale CLAUDE.md is worse than no CLAUDE.md.
